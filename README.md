When Buyer initializes an escrow transaction, his Ether is locked in the smart contract. Once Buyer confirms the Sellerâ€™s obligations are fulfilled, he can release funds to Seller. An Escrow Agent, chosen by the Buyer and Seller oversees the transaction. If a dispute occurs, the Escrow Agent can intervene and refund the Buyer, or release funds to the Seller.
